        <h1>Rakshabandhan</h1>
        <p>Raksha Bandhan is a festival that is celebrated on the full moon day in the month of Shravan according to the Hindu Lunar calendar. This day is observed as the day of siblings as on this day sisters and brothers come together to express their love for each other and also pray for their well being. The sisters tie a knot of rakhi on the wrist of her brother, who promises to protect his sister from the evil. Today, this festival is not only celebrated among the siblings, but also between friends and the close ones to whom the people want to spread their message of love and care.</p>
