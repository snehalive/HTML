            <p><I>Here is a picture of my son having a fruit salad for breakfast. There is nothing better than starting the day with fresh fruit straight from nature. Kiwi, mango and strawberries. Yummy! Offer variety and please don’t give up if your child is picky with certain fruits. It takes time to accept a new flavor. My son did not like kiwi until the 10th or 11th time I offered it to him. It is now one of his favorite fruits. This fun Monsters Inc fruit tart is a great way to introduce kiwi to your kids! here</I></p>
